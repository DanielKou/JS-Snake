		<h4>Instructions</h4>
		<p>Control the snakes with the arrow keys. The arrow keys will directly correspond to the blue snake, but inversly control the black one. That is, moving the blue snake down will cause the black snake to move up. The blue snake must eat the blue food and black snake must eat the black food. You lose the game by touching the walls, touching the other snake, or eating the wrong coloured food.</p>
